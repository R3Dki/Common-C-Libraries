# Common C Libraries<br>
## Description<br>
This repository contains libraries I made that are used in some of my C projects.<br><br>
## Libraries
### Types Library<br>
Contains type definitions that are quicker and easier to use than normal variable definitions.
It also contains some specific types that are used in the Bit Operations Library or can be used explicitly for types that are used for bit operations.<br>
### Bit Operations Library<br>
Contains useful functions when bit level data manipulation is needed.
### Utilities Library
Contains functions that might be useful in probably every C program.
When completed it'll be separated in several libraries with more specific purposes.

# Documentation will eventually be released, for now you'll have to rely on your intuition or function descriptions i included.
